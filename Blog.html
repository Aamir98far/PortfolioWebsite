            <h2>Learn about HTML</h2>
            <p>HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create web pages and display content on the internet. It serves as the foundation for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. Here are some key points about HTML:</p>
            <button class="btn btn-sm">Read More</button>
            <p>Key features and characteristics of HTML:</p>
        <div class="ol">
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Markup Language:</strong> HTML is a markup language, not a programming language. It uses tags (enclosed in angle brackets) to define the structure and elements of a web page. These tags provide instructions on how the content should be displayed in a web browser.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hierarchical Structure:</strong> HTML documents have a hierarchical structure with a root element (usually html) that contains other elements like head (for metadata) and body (for the main content). Elements can be nested inside one another to create complex structures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Text and Multimedia Content:</strong> HTML allows you to display text, images, videos, audio, links, forms, and more on a web page. Each type of content is represented by specific HTML tags. For example, text is enclosed in `p' (paragraph) or `h1` (heading) tags, while images use the `img` tag.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hyperlinks:</strong> HTML is instrumental in creating hyperlinks. Links are created with the `a` (anchor) tag, enabling users to navigate between web pages or resources by clicking on them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Semantic Markup:</strong> HTML5 introduced a focus on semantic elements, which means using tags that describe the meaning of the content rather than just its presentation. Examples of semantic elements include `article`, `section`, `header`, `footer`, and `nav`. These elements help search engines and assistive technologies understand the content's structure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cross-Browser Compatibility:</strong> Modern web browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, support HTML standards, ensuring that web pages appear consistently across different browsers and platforms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Evolution:</strong> HTML has gone through several versions, with HTML5 being the latest major revision. HTML5 introduced many new features and improvements, including better support for multimedia, enhanced forms, and increased compatibility with mobile devices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> HTML supports accessibility features that enable people with disabilities to access and understand web content. Properly structured HTML, along with attributes like alt text for images and ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) roles, enhances web accessibility.</li>
                    <li><strong>CSS and JavaScript:</strong> While HTML defines the structure and content of a web page, it is often complemented by Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. These technologies work together to create visually appealing and dynamic web experiences.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p>In summary, HTML is the fundamental language of the web, allowing developers to structure and present content for online consumption. It is a crucial skill for web developers and designers, as it forms the basis for creating websites and web applications.</p>

            <h2>Learn about CSS</h2>
            <p>CSS, which stands for "Cascading Style Sheets," is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation and styling of web documents written in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). CSS is a fundamental technology for web development and is essential for controlling the layout, design, and visual presentation of web pages. Here are some key aspects of CSS:</p>
            <button class="btn btn-sm">Read More</button>
            <p>Key features and characteristics of CSS:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Styling Web Pages:</strong> CSS allows web developers to define how HTML elements should be displayed on a web page. This includes specifying attributes like colors, fonts, spacing, borders, backgrounds, and more. By applying CSS rules, you can control the visual appearance of text, images, links, and other page elements.</li>
                <li><strong>Separation of Content and Presentation:</strong> One of the core principles of web development is the separation of content (HTML) from presentation (CSS). This separation makes it easier to maintain and update web pages. Content can be structured semantically in HTML, while CSS handles how that content is styled and laid out.</li>
                <li><strong>Selectors and Rules:</strong> CSS uses selectors to target specific HTML elements on a web page. Selectors can be based on element types, classes, IDs, attributes, and more. CSS rules, defined in a stylesheet, specify the styling properties for the selected elements. For example, you can create a rule to change the color of all &lt;h1&gt; headers or style elements with a specific class.</li>
                <li><strong>Cascading Nature:</strong> The "cascading" aspect of CSS refers to the order of priority that styles are applied. Styles can be inherited from parent elements, overridden by more specific rules, or influenced by the order in which stylesheets are linked. Understanding the cascade is crucial for managing complex styles.</li>
                <li><strong>Responsive Web Design:</strong> CSS plays a vital role in creating responsive web designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. Media queries in CSS allow you to apply different styles based on factors like screen width, enabling a consistent user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Animations and Transitions:</strong> CSS also provides the capability to create animations and transitions without the need for JavaScript. You can use CSS to add subtle visual effects like fading, sliding, or rotating elements on a web page.</li>
                <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> CSS is supported by all modern web browsers, making it a reliable technology for web development. However, cross-browser compatibility challenges may arise when dealing with older browser versions, requiring additional CSS code or workarounds.</li>
            </ul>
                <p>In summary, CSS is a powerful tool that web developers use to control the layout and appearance of web pages, ensuring that they are visually appealing and user-friendly. It complements the structure provided by HTML and enhances the overall user experience on the World Wide Web.</p>
